    <h1>Interesting facts about chess</h1>
    <p>The game of chess was probably invented in the sixth century AD in India under the name Chaturanga . The meaning of the name in Sanskrit is "four-armed", after the four types of units in the ancient Indian army - foot , cavalry , elephants and chariots . The rules of the game known today were probably established in the 16th century in Italy .

    <p>Judith Polgar , a Hungarian - Jewish chess player who played in men's chess competitions from her youth , won the grandmaster title in 1991 , when she was only 15 years and four months old , even earlier than Bobby Fischer . At the age of 12, Polgar, along with her sisters, won a gold medal in theWomen's Chess Olympiad , when she won 12.5 points out of a possible 13. At the peak of her ranking, she reached eighth place in the world , among both men and women, and is considered the best chess player in history. She beat some of the best chess players, such as Karpov , Shirov , Svidler , Anandand more. Her older sisters, Suzanne Polgar and Sofia Polgar , also reached impressive achievements, which included world championships , gold medals in the Olympics and grand master titles for men. The Polgar sisters received a home education from their parents, with an emphasis on chess and languages , because the father, the mathematician Laszlo Polgar, claimed that with proper education, geniuses can be produced in any field.</p>
